# Unity Car Race Game

Aim
In this experiment, I designed a simple 3D racing game.

- I designed a 3D terrain using Unity's terrain tools.
- I built some roads on this land.
- I made some buildings to make the terrain more realistic.
- I used some 3D tool assets to generate traffic.
- AI-made cars can travel at a constant speed on a fixed path.
- Added third-party camera tracking.
- Players reach the finish line in a certain time.
- The player can control the car with the arrow keys.
