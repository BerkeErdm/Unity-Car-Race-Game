# Unity Car Race Game

Aim
In this experiment, I designed a simple 3D racing game.

- A 3D terrain was designed using Unity's terrain tools.
- The software design was developed with C#.
- Added road design to the game's interface.
- Some buildings, social facilities, parks, and similar structures have been added to make the game's interface more realistic.
- Used some 3D vehicle assets to generate traffic.
- AI-made cars can travel at a constant speed on a fixed path.
- Added third-party camera tracking.
- Players reach the finish line in a certain time.
- The player can control the car with the arrow keys.
